This is a tutorial that tries to sell Python to X-ray astronomers in less than 2 hours. :)

There are four parts:

1. Using NumPy and matplotlib to read numerical data from a file, do some basic data handling, and plot the results.
2. Making publication-quality figures from FITS images using APLpy.
3. [Using PyXel to fit X-ray surface brightness profiles.](https://github.com/gogrean/PyXel/tree/master/examples/notebooks)
4. [Creating interactive temperature maps with Bokeh.](https://github.com/gogrean/InteractiveFigs/tree/master/X-rayMaps)

The notebooks for the first two parts are in this repository, while the others are in other repos on my GitHub page. 

The following packages are needed to run the code in this tutorial:

* Python 3 / Jupyter
* NumPy
* matplotlib
* Astropy
* APLpy (conda install aplpy)
* Bokeh (conda install bokeh)
* PyXel: https://github.com/gogrean/PyXel

All except the last three are included in the Anaconda Python distribution.
